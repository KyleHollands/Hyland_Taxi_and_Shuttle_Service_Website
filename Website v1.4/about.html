                excited to announce our new transportation service from Haliburton to Toronto! This route, previously
                managed by Tok Coachlines and Entertainment Tours, faced challenges due to decreased and inconsistent
                ridership and changes in business direction. To ensure we can keep this service running smoothly for the
                long term, we're using a smaller,
                22-seater bus. While fares have increased slightly, this change helps us maintain a sustainable,
                flexible, and reliable travel option for you. We're committed to providing you with the best service
                possible!
            </p>
